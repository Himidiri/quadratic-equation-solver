# Quadratic Equation Solver

This is a program that calculates and prints the real roots of a quadratic equation given its coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c`. The program implements the quadratic formula and considers the different possibilities for the discriminant (`b^2 - 4ac`) to determine the number and nature of the roots.
